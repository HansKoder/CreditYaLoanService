# Loan Service

## üìå Overview
The **Loan Service** manages the lifecycle of loans for each customer.  
It is responsible for:
- Create loan applications (Customer side)
- Retrieve loans (Advisor side)

This service is built following **Clean Architecture** principles to ensure testability, maintainability, and scalability.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture & Patterns

This service applies **Event Sourcing** and **CQRS** to separate responsibilities and provide traceability:

- **Event Sourcing**  
  Every important change (e.g. *LoanApplicationSubmitted*, *LoanApproved*) is stored as an **event** rather than only keeping the latest state.  
  This allows:
    - A full history of loan changes.
    - Replayability of events to rebuild state.
    - Auditability.

- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**  
  Separation of responsibilities between:
    - **Write model (Loan Aggregate)** ‚Üí Validates commands, applies business rules, and persists events in **PostgreSQL** (Event Store).
    - **Read model (LoanRead)** ‚Üí Stores projections in **MongoDB** for fast queries, filtering, and pagination.

üëâ This way:
- **Loan - Write** ‚Üí reliable and consistent business decisions.
- **Loan - Read** ‚Üí optimized, flexible views for queries.

> üìå A diagram will be included in the future to illustrate the flow.

## üìÇ Architecture Structure
- **Domain Layer**: Business rules (entities, value objects, domain events, contracts).
- **Application Layer**: Use cases (loan application, loan query, projections).
- **Infrastructure Layer**:
    - **Driven Adapters**:
        - R2dbc-postgresql (Postgres R2DBC)
        - Mongo (Mongo Reactive)
        - Security (JWT)
        - Event Dispatcher (publishes domain events to projections)
        - Rest Consumer (in order to check customer exist make request to customer-service)
    - **Entry Points**:
        - Reactive Web (WebFlux handlers / routers)
